        <p>
            Thank you for choosing The Pacific Art. </br></br>We are committed to ensuring your satisfaction with every
            purchase. If you are not entirely satisfied with your order, we are here to help. Below is our refund policy:
            </br><b>Eligibility for Refunds</b></br>
            To be eligible for a refund, please ensure that:</br>
            • The item is returned in its original condition, with no signs of wear, damage, or alteration.</br>
            • The return request is made within 14 days of receiving your order.</br>
            • The item is returned in its original packaging, including any certificates of authenticity, if provided.</br>
            </br>Non-Refundable Items
            Certain items are exempt from refunds, including:</br>
            • Gift cards.</br>
            • Custom or personalized art pieces.</br>
            • Items marked as final sale.</br>
            </br>Process for Returns and Refunds</br>
            1. Initiating a Return: To start the return process, contact our customer support team at [insert contact
            email/phone] with your order details, reason for return, and any supporting images if applicable.</br>
            2. Return Authorization: Once your request is approved, we will provide instructions for returning the item.
            Unauthorized returns will not be accepted.</br>
            3. Shipping Returns: Customers are responsible for return shipping costs unless the item was received damaged or
            incorrect. We recommend using a trackable shipping service and purchasing shipping insurance to ensure your
            return is safely received. We are not liable for lost or damaged returns.</br>
            4. Inspection and Refunds: Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will notify you of the approval or
            rejection of your refund. Approved refunds will be processed within 7-10 business days, and a credit will
            automatically be applied to your original payment method.</br>
            </br>Damaged or Defective Items</br>
            If your item arrives damaged or defective, please notify us within 48 hours of delivery. Provide photos of the
            damaged item and packaging to expedite the resolution process. Depending on the situation, we may offer a
            replacement, store credit, or a full refund.</br>
            Exchanges</br>
            We do not offer direct exchanges. If you wish to replace an item, please return it for a refund (if eligible)
            and place a new order for the desired product.</br>
            </br>Late or Missing Refunds</br>
